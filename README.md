# Investigating the impact of sex hormones on immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: The approach of transcriptome analysis
This repository contains the code and analysis for a project investigating the transcriptomic impact of sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) on gene expression related to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). The goal is to identify key genes and molecular pathways that are influenced by hormone levels and may contribute to disease pathogenesis.
## Repository Structure
- <code>data/:</code> Contains raw and processed data files

- <code>scripts/:</code> Holds Jupyter or R codedown notebooks and R scripts for analyses

- <code>results/:</code> Stores output files from the analysis.
## Requirements
To replicate the analysis, you will need the following software:
- Python

- R (version 4.0 or higher)

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:

- git clone https://github.com/ngduylinh911/sex_hormone_IMID_transcriptome.git

- Place your data files in the data/ directory.

- Run the main analysis scripts/notebooks to reproduce the results.

## Data request
The data will be provided upon request, as some of the study data, particularly that within the <code>data/PBMC/</code> folder, has not yet been published.

## Contact
For any questions, feel free to open an issue or contact bt24807@qmul.ac.uk
